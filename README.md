# Distributed Mean Estimation

As part of my final year honors project, I worked on the problem of distributed mean estimation. The problem involves m clients each having a distinct vector and one server that would like to estimate the mean of the m vectors. This problem is simple if there are no constraints. We solved this problem under communication constraints i.e, each client can only send one or constant number of bits for each coordinate of the vector. We came up with a communication scheme that achieves order optimal MSE while using only constant number of bits per dimension.
